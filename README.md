In this homework, we will find shortest-paths in graphs with a single source node.

Problem 1: Bellman-Ford Algorithm 50 points

Demonstrate Bellman-Ford algorithm on the following graph. In each stage of the algorithm, clearly state the shortest distance estimate at each node from the source.

Demonstrate Dijkstra’s algorithm on the following graph. In each stage of the algorithm, clearly state the shortest distance estimate at each node from the source.

Bonus Problem (10 points):

Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm on graphs represented as adjacency lists in Python, and val-idate your code on the example graph given in Problem 2.
